Hey what's up, my name is Anthony Hall and I am a sophomore in highschool,

I started programming/scripting when I was 9 years old in HTML and javascript so I have TONS of experience in the web development space.

I took some interest in python and c# later on when I was 11.

and started ReactJS and NextJS when I was 13

I have never worked on a team project with other developers and I look forward to it.
